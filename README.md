Tic Tac Toe
=========================== 

A single and multiplayer tic-tac-toe game developed in React

## Notes

The single player option uses an algorithm called minmax, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and look at a C++ implementation [here](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/).
